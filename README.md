Reflection

Some of the new knowledge that I have regarding 
The coding and language aspect of the project is
The ability to use third party libraries to play 
Mp3 files. Jaco mp3 is the one that we used but 
There are many other ways to use other libraries 
For the same thing.

To do this we had a song class that had the ability 
To play mp3 files by changing the filename in the 
Code section.

When it comes to project management I learned the 
Importance of a plan weather it be the agile methods
Or any other method of planning. Also github is very 
Inportant

For time management the interviews for the sprints
Helped us plan specific action oriented goals

The problems for the playing of the mp3 files could 
Be overcome by trial and error of working around the
Jaco library.

Ultimately i learned the importance of planning 
And working with a group for a program
